This program demonstrates stream piping in Node.js. 
It reads data from 'input.txt' using a Readable stream and writes it into 'output.txt' using a Writable stream. 
The pipe method connects both streams so data flows automatically. 
Error handling ensures issues in reading or writing are reported. 
The result is that 'output.txt' becomes a copy of 'input.txt'.
